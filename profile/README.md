# Databricks Demos

This organization contains demos and best practices for Databricks.

## dbdemos

Our main project is [dbdemos](https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos). 

dbdemos deploys end 2 end demos and product-oriented demos (ex: Delta Live Table, CDC, MLOps...) in one line of code.

Demos are installed and pre-loaded with DBSQL dashboard, DLT Pipelines, Clusters, models etc.
